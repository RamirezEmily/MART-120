    <h1>The Voice in the Wall</h1>
    <p>By the fourth day, a voice answered</p>
    <p>But the wall it came from was bare</p>
    <p>The voice would speak and give assurance</p>
    <p>But all the boy could do was stare</p>
    <p>Five days had passed since they met</p>
    <p>The boy and the voice were best of friends</p>
    <p>Yet they had never seen each other's faces</p>
    <p>And the two would talk till each other ends</p>
